This is my Final Year Project.
Employee Tasks Management System.

The system will assist the IT Lab to manage the work duty of the technician in terms of daily work schedule including overtime activities that were requested by users. The work activities must be approved by the manager. 
The employee can view and print the monthly record of overtime to be endorsed by the IT Lab manager and submit it to the HR department for the claim's processing and approval.

This project is still incomplete
